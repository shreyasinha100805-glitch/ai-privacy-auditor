# 🛡️ AI Privacy Auditor

## 📖 Overview
This repository hosts the code and documentation for the **AI Privacy Auditor**, a tool/framework designed to systematically assess and audit Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems for compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and privacy best practices.

It focuses on identifying and mitigating privacy risks such as **Membership Inference Attacks**, **Model Inversion**, and general data leakage throughout the AI lifecycle (data collection, training, deployment).

## ✨ Key Features
* **Data Leakage Assessment:** Tools to quantify the risk of sensitive data exposure from a trained model.
* **Compliance Checklists:** Structured checklists based on major data privacy regulations.
* **Differential Privacy Implementation:** Utilities for applying and verifying Differential Privacy mechanisms.
* **Audit Reporting:** Generates comprehensive reports on privacy risk and compliance status.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* `pip` package installer
* Specific ML libraries (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow, depending on the tool's implementation)

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/ai-privacy-auditor.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/ai-privacy-auditor.git)
    cd ai-privacy-auditor
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🛠️ Usage
(This section would include a short code snippet showing how to run the main audit script.)

**Example:**
To run a basic privacy audit on a model and dataset configuration file:

```bash
python run_audit.py --config configs/default_audit.yaml
